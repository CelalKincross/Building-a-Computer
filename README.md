# Building-a-Computer: Nand to Tetris from the Elements of Computing Systems
# This course starts with a simple Nand gate and requires you to build a CPU, assembler, and all the 
# necessary hardware for a computer using hardware simulation. You then build a tetris game or any
# game that you fancy.
